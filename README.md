# Airbnb-X-Renda-Segura

- <b>What is the business problem that will be addressed?</b>

Gentrification is an issue that the municipality of Lisbon is facing since several years. Very recently, following the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and a massive economic downturn, the municipality introduced a program called [Renda Segura](https://www.globaldata.com/lisbons-renda-segura-program-could-be-problematic-for-airbnb-if-successful-says-globaldata/). In the context of this program, the municipality rents apartments from private agents and sublets them to families and young people at a lower price. In this way, the municipality aims to get short-term rentals, such as Airbnbs, back into the long-term rental market and lower the overall housing prices. 
This project will assess the current situation in the Lisbon Airbnb market and advise the municipality regarding the price it should offer to Airbnb landlords in order to achieve the goal of bringing short-term rentals back into the long-term rental market. 

- <b>What data will be used and the reason for their relevance for the business question?</b>

To answer the business question it will be used data collected [insideairbnb website](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). Insideairbnb.com is a website that provides insightful analytics about the Airbnb characteristics that distinguish different areas around the globe. More in detail, the Lisbon dataset allows to gather data regarding description, location, availability, price, owner ID, and consequently the property-per-owner ratio, review scores, and different typology of renting (i.e. private/shared rooms). In addition to essential data such as price, capacity, and location, reviews and typology of renting will play a role in the analysis because of their informative potential, especially if proven a correlation with prices. 

- <b>Overview of the main analysis that will be performed and explanation of how do it bridge between the data and the business questions</b> 

First of all,  the development in recent years will be described as well as the current situation in the Lisbon Airbnb market in terms of the number of Airbnbs, prices, location, and capacity utilization to explore the context, size, and significance of the problem. 

Secondly, an analysis of the density of airbnb apartments per square kilometer for each neighborhood in the city of Lisbon will be carried out, so that the impact of the decrease in the number of tourists on the economic ecosystem of the neighborhood can be assessed. The *main goal* is to advise the municipality which neighborhoods are most affected by the drastic decrease in incoming tourist flows so that young people can live there and create new social dynamics within the neighborhood that favor a more sustainable and robust economic growth. 

Finally, a scenario analysis will be carried out with 3 different values of covid impact on the tourism sector and how many apartments the municipality could be dragged back into the long-term rental market. As the year 2020 is very exceptional, we will refer to data until 2019 and estimate post-pandemic prices and supply of Airbnbs using forecasts of tourism activity of relevant (inter-)national institutions.
